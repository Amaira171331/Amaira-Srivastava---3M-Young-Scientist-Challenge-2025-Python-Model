I, Amaira Srivastava, created a predictive nonlinear saturation model using Python to approximate flavonoid release from 
my novel invention, the FlavoPeel Cup, over longer periods of time, and find the time of eventual saturation. 
I used the numpy library to store my data in numpy arrays and perform complex mathematical equations. 
I also used matplotlib to create my graph and animate it. Finally, I used scipy to fit the curve on my exponential model. 
This model is a saturation model because the flavonoid rate of release continues to decrease exponentially, before it reaches an eventual plateau, which is the saturation point.
The saturation model was the best fit for my project because it shows the diffusion of flavonoids over time. At the beginning, diffusion is fast. Over time, as the water becomes saturated, diffusion slows 
and eventually, no more flavonoids dissolve, which is the saturation point. 
The data I used for this model is the mass of hesperidin diffused from from 5 to 120 minutes. Then the model used its predictive modeling to find the diffusion till 300 minutes, 
since saturation for room temp. water is reached at around 240 mis.
